Coverage summary after adding tests for fallback paths:

src/service.py: 97% coverage
- Branches covered include:
  - main model success for normal inputs
  - fallback model when input is short
  - fallback when main model predict raises
  - error handling for None input
  - empty input main model failure -> fallback

Tools used:
- pytest
- pytest-cov
- coverage

Artifacts generated by running `./run_tests.sh` or `./run_tests.ps1`:
- Console coverage summary
- `htmlcov/index.html` — interactive coverage report
- `coverage.xml` — XML coverage for CI/codecov
- `test_output.log` — combined test output and coverage summary

Notes:
- `tests/conftest.py` ensures top-level repo root is added to sys.path so `pytest -v` works in any shell (PowerShell or bash)
